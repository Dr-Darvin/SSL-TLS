SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a protocol used to secure the connection between 2 entities.
TLS(Transport Layer security) is a more secured version of SSL.
both are used interchangeably to refer the same thing
this protocol does 2 functions
  1.Encrypts the communication
  2.Verify the remote user's identity
  
 How HTTPS works using TLS
  1.First TCP handshake occurs(TCP SYN,TCP SYN+ACK,TCP ACK)
  2.Client send the hello message with its supported TLS versions and cyphers
  3.Server sends its certificate which includes its identiy and public key
  4.client encypts its symmetric session key using server's public key and send it
  5.server decrypts the session key using it's private key
  6.Finally data tranferring happens between 2 entities securly
